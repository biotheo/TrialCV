## Experience

### Research

#### [current] Fellowship Researcher 
**Dept. of Agricultural and Forest Sciences, University of Turin, Italy**  
**Research Group**: *Forest Entomology and Zoology* (Coordinator: Professor Chiara Ferracini)

**Main Objectives**:
- Field inspection, identification and sampling of phytophagous insects in chestnut orchards.
- Soil sample collection for biodiversity analysis to sustainably manage chestnut pests (Curculio elephas and Cydia spp.).
- Ambrosia beetles monitoring in chestnut orchards (subfamily Scolytinae).

### Teaching

#### [2024] Teaching Tutor  
**Dept. of Life Science and System Biology, University of Turin, Italy**  
**Ministerial High School Project**

**Main Tasks**:
- Organized school trips under the ministerial project "Piano Lauree Scientifiche - Biodiversity and Ecosystems," aiming to engage new high school graduates in biology.
- Delivered theoretical lessons to high school classes on insect biodiversity and the role of a biologist in this field.
- Guided students in La Mandria Park to test classical fieldwork methods (e.g., Pollard’s linear transect, Mark Release and Recapture) to collect quantitative and qualitative data on butterfly communities.
- Taught basic statistical analysis (e.g., biodiversity indices), which students applied to their fieldwork data.

#### [2024] Teaching Tutor  
**Dept. of Life Science and System Biology, University of Turin, Italy**  
**Teaching Tutor in Turin’s Penitentiary**

**Main Tasks**:
- Tutored the Human Anatomy course for inmate students pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in sports science in a special block of Turin's penitentiary.
- Prepared a summarized version of the course, considering the limited time and resources available.
- Conducted lessons autonomously, covering all key points of the course (officially held by Prof. Luca Pradotto), using slides and administering a mid-term exam (both prepared independently).
